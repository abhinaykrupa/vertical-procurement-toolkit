AI-drafted prospect follow-up email generator.

MOCKED in the POC. Production replaces draft_outreach_email() with a Claude
Sonnet call using the prompt below. The mock generates output that is
structurally and tonally what the real model would return.
"""


PRODUCTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a sales rep drafting a personalized follow-up email after
delivering a savings analysis to {practice_name}, a {locations}-location {specialty}
practice in {state}.

Their identified annual savings: ${identified_savings:,} ({savings_pct}% of current
${annual_spend:,} supply budget).

Top savings categories: {top_categories}.

Draft a 4-paragraph email with:
- Subject line that hooks on a specific savings number
- Greeting that references the practice's specialty
- One concrete "did you know" insight tied to their savings
- Soft CTA suggesting a 15-minute call
- Tone: confident but not pushy. Short paragraphs, direct.

Return JSON: {{ "subject": ..., "body": ... }}

Wanted to circle back on the savings analysis we put together for {practice} last week.

The short version: we identified **${savings:,} in annual savings** ({pct}% off your current ${spend:,} supply budget), driven mostly by {cats_phrase}. That's on the exact same product mix you're buying today — same manufacturers, same pack sizes — just at our negotiated pricing.

One thing that stood out for {location_phrase}: you're carrying meaningful spend on {specialty_hook}, which is exactly where our negotiated rates run deepest. {social_proof}

If you want to walk through the line-item breakdown, I'm happy to grab 15 minutes this week or next. No pressure — but the longer we wait, the more savings keep sitting on the table each month.

Happy to send the full audit report ahead of the call if that helps.

Best,
{rep}
